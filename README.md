# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the existing site for a marketing agency. We wanted to add accessibility for people with disabilities and to optimize the site for search engines. I added semantic HTML elements to be more descriptive with the content. Using semantic HTML elements also allowed me to consolidate CSS selectors and properties.
